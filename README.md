# Dashboard with Next.js

The aim of the project was to recreate the Dashboard based on the project found on Behance. I implemented the charts.js library to handle charts, Firebase Authentication to log in, I connected the application to the Firestore Database to store data, forms are supported by React-hook-form libraries.
